abstract = {In view of the possibility that vertical convection and turbulence can be suppressed in the early phase of a solar nebula because of a reduction of dust opacity's temperature dependence that is caused by rapid dust particle growth, a reexamination is made of dust particle settling and growth phenomena in the subsequent, laminar phase of the solar nebula. The settling process is noted to be divided into an early, gas-dominated phase and a later dust-dominated one. Dust particles grow to the greatest size and with the greatest speed in a radially sweeping particle path phase. Most of the settling time, however, is spent in the early vertical settling phase.},

abstract = {Simulations have shown that a diverse range of extrasolar terrestrial planet bulk compositions are likely to exist based on the observed variations in host star elemental abundances. Based on recent studies, it is expected that a significant proportion of host stars may have Mg/Si ratios below 1. Here we examine this previously neglected group of systems. Planets simulated as forming within these systems are found to be Mg-depleted (compared to Earth), consisting of silicate species such as pyroxene and various feldspars. Planetary carbon abundances also vary in accordance with the host star C/O ratio. The predicted abundances are in keeping with observations of polluted white dwarfs, lending validity to this approach. Further studies are required to determine the full planetary impacts of the bulk compositions predicted here.},

abstract = {In the core accretion model for giant planet formation, a solid core forms by coagulation of dust grains in a protoplanetary disk and then accretes gas from the disk when the core reaches a critical mass. Both stages must be completed in a few million years before the disk gas disperses. The slowest stage of this process may be oligarchic growth in which a giant-planet core grows by sweeping up smaller, asteroid-size planetesimals. Here, we describe new numerical simulations of oligarchic growth using a particle-in-a-box model. The simulations include several processes that can effect oligarchic growth: (i) planetesimal fragmentation due to mutual collisions, (ii) the modified capture rate of planetesimals due to a core's atmosphere, (iii) drag with the disk gas during encounters with the core (so-called ``pebble accretion''), (iv) modification of particle velocities by turbulence and drift caused by gas drag, (v) the presence of a population of mm-to-m size ``pebbles'' that represent the transition point between disruptive collisions between larger particles, and mergers between dust grains, and (vi) radial drift of small objects due to gas drag. Collisions between planetesimals rapidly generate a population of pebbles. The rate at which a core sweeps up pebbles is controlled by pebble accretion dynamics. Metre-size pebbles lose energy during an encounter with a core due to drag, and settle towards the core, greatly increasing the capture probability during a single encounter. Millimetre-size pebbles are tightly coupled to the gas and most are swept past the core during an encounter rather than being captured. Accretion efficiency per encounter increases with pebble size in this size range. However, radial drift rates also increase with size, so metre-size objects encounter a core on many fewer occasions than mm-size pebbles before they drift out of a region. The net result is that core growth rates vary weakly with pebble size, with the optimal diameter being about 10 cm. The main effect of planetesimal size is to determine the rate of mutual collisions, fragment production and the formation of pebbles. 1-km-diameter planetesimals collide frequently and have low impact strengths, leading to a large surface density of pebbles and rapid core growth via pebble accretion. 100-km-diameter planetesimals produce fewer pebbles, and pebble accretion plays a minor role in this case. The strength of turbulence in the gas determines the scale height of pebbles in the disk, which affects the rate at which they are accreted. For an initial solid surface density of 12 g/cm2 at 5 AU, with 10-cm diameter pebbles and a disk viscosity parameter $\alpha$=10-4, a 10-Earth mass core can form in 3 My for 1-10 km diameter planetesimals. The growth of such a core requires longer than 3 My if planetesimals are 100 km in diameter.},

abstract = {We describe the diffusion and random velocities of solid particles due to stochastic forcing by turbulent gas. We include the orbital dynamics of Keplerian disks, both in-plane epicycles and vertical oscillations. We obtain a new result for the diffusion of solids. The Schmidt number (ratio of gas to particle diffusivity) is Sc≈1+(, in terms of the particle stopping time t and the orbital frequency $\Omega$. The standard result, Sc=1+t/t, in terms of the eddy turnover time, t, is shown to be incorrect. The main difference is that Sc rises quadratically, not linearly, with stopping time. Consequently, particles larger than ˜10 cm in protoplanetary disks will suffer less radial diffusion and will settle closer to the midplane. Such a layer of boulders would be more prone to gravitational collapse. Our predictions of RMS speeds, vertical scale height and diffusion coefficients will help interpret numerical simulations. We confirm previous results for the vertical stirring of particles (scale heights and random velocities), and add a correction for arbitrary ratios of eddy to orbital times. The particle layer becomes thinner for t>1/$\Omega$ with the strength of turbulent diffusion held fixed. We use two analytic techniques---the Hinze-Tchen formalism and the Fokker-Planck equation with velocity diffusion---with identical results when the regimes of validity overlap. We include simple physical arguments for the scaling of our results.},

abstract = {A visual examination of the images from the Galactic Legacy Infrared Mid-Plane Survey Extraordinaire (GLIMPSE) has revealed 322 partial and closed rings that we propose represent partially or fully enclosed three-dimensional bubbles. We argue that the bubbles are primarily formed by hot young stars in massive star formation regions. We have found an average of about 1.5 bubbles per square degree. About 25% of the bubbles coincide with known radio H II regions, and about 13% enclose known star clusters. It appears that B4-B9 stars (too cool to produce detectable radio H II regions) probably produce about three-quarters of the bubbles in our sample, and the remainder are produced by young O-B3 stars that produce detectable radio H II regions. Some of the bubbles may be the outer edges of H II regions where PAH spectral features are excited and may not be dynamically formed by stellar winds. Only three of the bubbles are identified as known SNRs. No bubbles coincide with known planetary nebulae or W-R stars in the GLIMPSE survey area. The bubbles are small. The distribution of angular diameters peaks between 1' and 3' with over 98% having angular diameters less than 10' and 88% less than 4'. Almost 90% have shell thicknesses between 0.2 and 0.4 of their outer radii. Bubble shell thickness increases approximately linearly with shell radius. The eccentricities are rather large, peaking between 0.6 and 0.7; about 65% have eccentricities between 0.55 and 0.85.},

abstract = {We have developed a one-dimensional photochemical and thermochemical kinetics and diffusion model to study the effects of disequilibrium chemistry on the atmospheric composition of "hot-Jupiter" exoplanets. Here we investigate the coupled chemistry of neutral carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen species on HD 189733b and HD 209458b and we compare the model results with existing transit and eclipse observations. We find that the vertical profiles of molecular constituents are significantly affected by transport-induced quenching and photochemistry, particularly on the cooler HD 189733b however, the warmer stratospheric temperatures on HD 209458b help maintain thermochemical equilibrium and reduce the effects of disequilibrium chemistry. For both planets, the methane and ammonia mole fractions are found to be enhanced over their equilibrium values at pressures of a few bar to less than an mbar due to transport-induced quenching, but CH4 and NH3 are photochemically removed at higher altitudes. Disequilibrium chemistry also enhances atomic species, unsaturated hydrocarbons (particularly C2H2), some nitriles (particularly HCN), and radicals like OH, CH3, and NH2. In contrast, CO, H2O, N2, and CO2 more closely follow their equilibrium profiles, except at pressures lsim1 $\mu$bar, where CO, H2O, and N2 are photochemically destroyed and CO2 is produced before its eventual high-altitude destruction. The enhanced abundances of CH4, NH3, and HCN are expected to affect the spectral signatures and thermal profiles of HD 189733b and other relatively cool, transiting exoplanets. We examine the sensitivity of our results to the assumed temperature structure and eddy diffusion coefficients and discuss further observational consequences of these models.},

abstract = {Two decades ago, empirical evidence concerning the existence and frequency of planets around stars, other than our own, was absent. Since that time, the detection of extrasolar planets from Jupiter-sized to, most recently, Earth-sized worlds has blossomed and we are finally able to shed light on the plurality of Earth-like, habitable planets in the cosmos. Extrasolar moons may also be frequently habitable worlds, but their detection or even systematic pursuit remains lacking in the current literature. Here, we present a description of the first systematic search for extrasolar moons as part of a new observational project called "The Hunt for Exomoons with Kepler" (HEK). The HEK project distills the entire list of known transiting planet candidates found by Kepler (2326 at the time of writing) down to the most promising candidates for hosting a moon. Selected targets are fitted using a multimodal nested sampling algorithm coupled with a planet-with-moon light curve modeling routine. By comparing the Bayesian evidence of a planet-only model to that of a planet-with-moon, the detection process is handled in a Bayesian framework. In the case of null detections, upper limits derived from posteriors marginalized over the entire prior volume will be provided to inform the frequency of large moons around viable planetary hosts, \eta _{\leftmoon}\!. After discussing our methodologies for target selection, modeling, fitting, and vetting, we provide two example analyses.},

abstract = {Traditionally stellar radiation has been the only heat source considered capable of determining global climate on long timescales. Here we show that terrestrial exoplanets orbiting low-mass stars may be tidally heated at high enough levels to induce a runaway greenhouse for a long enough duration for all the hydrogen to escape. Without hydrogen, the planet no longer has water and cannot support life. We call these planets "Tidal Venuses," and the phenomenon a "tidal greenhouse." Tidal effects also circularize the orbit, which decreases tidal heating. Hence, some planets may form with large eccentricity, with its accompanying large tidal heating, and lose their water, but eventually settle into nearly circular orbits in the habitable zone (HZ). However, these planets are not habitable as past tidal heating desiccated them, and hence should not be ranked highly for detailed follow-up observations aimed at detecting biosignatures. We simulate the evolution of hypothetical planetary systems in a quasi-continuous parameter distribution and find that we can constrain the history of the system by statistical arguments. Planets orbiting stars with masses <0.3 solar masses may be in danger of desiccation via tidal heating. We apply these concepts to Gl 667C c, a ~4.5 earth-mass planet orbiting a 0.3 solar mass star at 0.12 AU. We find that it probably did not lose its water via tidal heating as orbital stability is unlikely for the high eccentricities required for the tidal greenhouse. As the inner edge of the HZ is defined by the onset of a runaway or moist greenhouse powered by radiation, our results represent a fundamental revision to the HZ for non-circular orbits. In the appendices we review a) the moist and runaway greenhouses, b) stellar mass-radius and mass-luminosity relations, c) terrestrial planet mass-radius relations, and d) linear tidal theories.},

abstract = {The formation of giant planets requires the accumulation of ~10 Earth masses in solids; but how do protoplanets acquire their mass? There are many, often competing, processes that regulate the accretion rate of protoplanets. To assess their effects we present a new, publicly available toy model. The rationale behind the toy model is that it encompasses as many physically relevant processes as possible, but at the same time does not compromise its simplicity, speed, and physical insight. The toy model follows a modular structure, where key features---e.g., planetesimal fragmentation, radial orbital decay, nebula turbulence---can be switched on or off. Our model assumes three discrete components (fragments, planetesimals, and embryos) and is zero dimensional in space. We have tested the outcomes of the toy model against literature results and generally find satisfactory agreement. We include, for the first time, model features that capture the three-way interactions among small particles, gas, and protoplanets. Collisions among planetesimals will result in fragmentation, transferring a substantial amount of the solid mass to small particles, which couple strongly to the gas. Our results indicate that the efficiency of the accretion process then becomes very sensitive to the gas properties---especially to the turbulent state and the magnitude of the disk headwind (the decrease of the orbital velocity of the gas with respect to Keplerian)---as well as to the characteristic fragment size.},

abstract = {We report on the discovery of stellar occultations, observed with Kepler, which recur periodically at 15.685 hr intervals, but which vary in depth from a maximum of 1.3% to a minimum that can be less than 0.2%. The star that is apparently being occulted is KIC 12557548, a V = 16 mag K dwarf with T eff, s ~= 4400 K. The out-of-occultation behavior shows no evidence for ellipsoidal light variations, indicating that the mass of the orbiting object is less than ~3 M J (for an orbital period of 15.7 hr). Because the eclipse depths are highly variable, they cannot be due solely to transits of a single planet with a fixed size. We discuss but dismiss a scenario involving a binary giant planet whose mutual orbit plane precesses, bringing one of the planets into and out of a grazing transit. This scenario seems ruled out by the dynamical instability that would result from such a configuration. We also briefly consider an eclipsing binary, possibly containing an accretion disk, that either orbits KIC 12557548 in a hierarchical triple configuration or is nearby on the sky, but we find such a scenario inadequate to reproduce the observations. The much more likely explanation---but one which still requires more quantitative development---involves macroscopic particles escaping the atmosphere of a slowly disintegrating planet not much larger than Mercury in size. The particles could take the form of micron-sized pyroxene or aluminum oxide dust grains. The planetary surface is hot enough to sublimate and create a high-Z atmosphere; this atmosphere may be loaded with dust via cloud condensation or explosive volcanism. Atmospheric gas escapes the planet via a Parker-type thermal wind, dragging dust grains with it. We infer a mass-loss rate from the observations of order 1 M ⊕ Gyr-1, with a dust-to-gas ratio possibly of order unity. For our fiducial 0.1 M ⊕ planet (twice the mass of Mercury), the evaporation timescale may be ~0.2 Gyr. Smaller mass planets are disfavored because they evaporate still more quickly, as are larger mass planets because they have surface gravities too strong to sustain outflows with the requisite mass-loss rates. The occultation profile evinces an ingress-egress asymmetry that could reflect a comet-like dust tail trailing the planet; we present simulations of such a tail.},

abstract = {Since the discovery of the first exoplanets, it has been known that other planetary systems can look quite unlike our own. Until fairly recently, we have been able to probe only the upper range of the planet size distribution, and, since last year, to detect planets that are the size of Earth or somewhat smaller. Hitherto, no planets have been found that are smaller than those we see in the Solar System. Here we report a planet significantly smaller than Mercury. This tiny planet is the innermost of three that orbit the Sun-like host star, which we have designated Kepler-37. Owing to its extremely small size, similar to that of the Moon, and highly irradiated surface, the planet, Kepler-37b, is probably rocky with no atmosphere or water, similar to Mercury.},

abstract = {Tides raised on a planet by the gravity of its host star can reduce the planet's orbital semi-major axis and eccentricity. This effect is only relevant for planets orbiting very close to their host stars. The habitable zones of low-mass stars are also close in, and tides can alter the orbits of planets in these locations. We calculate the tidal evolution of hypothetical terrestrial planets around low-mass stars and show that tides can evolve planets past the inner edge of the habitable zone, sometimes in less than 1 billion years. This migration requires large eccentricities (>0.5) and low-mass stars (≲0.35 M{\&}sun;). Such migration may have important implications for the evolution of the atmosphere, internal heating, and the Gaia hypothesis. Similarly, a planet that is detected interior to the habitable zone could have been habitable in the past. We consider the past habitability of the recently discovered, ˜5 M⊕ planet, Gliese 581 c. We find that it could have been habitable for reasonable choices of orbital and physical properties as recently as 2 Gyr ago. However, when constraints derived from the additional companions are included, most parameter choices that indicate past habitability require the two inner planets of the system to have crossed their mutual 3:1 mean motion resonance. As this crossing would likely have resulted in resonance capture, which is not observed, we conclude that Gl 581 c was probably never habitable.},

abstract = {We provide an overview of stellar variability in the first quarter data from the Kepler mission. The intent of this paper is to examine the entire sample of over 150,000 target stars for periodic behavior in their light curves and relate this to stellar characteristics. This data set constitutes an unprecedented study of stellar variability given its great precision and complete time coverage (with a half hour cadence). Because the full Kepler pipeline is not currently suitable for a study of stellar variability of this sort, we describe our procedures for treating the "raw" pipeline data. About half of the total sample exhibits convincing periodic variability up to two weeks, with amplitudes ranging from differential intensity changes of less than 10-4 up to more than 10%. K and M dwarfs have a greater fraction of period behavior than G dwarfs. The giants in the sample have distinctive quasi-periodic behavior, but are not periodic in the way we define it. Not all periodicities are due to rotation, and the most significant period is not necessarily the rotation period. We discuss properties of the light curves, and in particular look at a sample of very clearly periodic G dwarfs. It is clear that a large number of them do vary because of rotation and starspots, but it will take further analysis to fully exploit this.},

abstract = {Though ~10 Earth mass rocky/icy cores are commonly held as a prerequisite for the formation of gas giants, theoretical models still struggle to explain how these embryos can form within the lifetimes of gaseous circumstellar disks. In recent years, aerodynamic-aided accretion of "pebbles," objects ranging from centimeters to meters in size, has been suggested as a potential solution to this long-standing problem. While pebble accretion has been demonstrated to be extremely effective in local simulations that look at the detailed behavior of these pebbles in the vicinity of a single planetary embryo, to date there have been no global simulations demonstrating the effectiveness of pebble accretion in a more complicated, multi-planet environment. Therefore, we have incorporated the aerodynamic-aided accretion physics into LIPAD, a Lagrangian code that can follow the collisional / accretional / dynamical evolution of a protoplanetary system, to investigate how pebble accretion manifests itself in the larger planet formation picture. We find that under generic circumstances, pebble accretion naturally leads to an "oligarchic" type of growth in which a large number of planetesimals grow to similar-sized planets. In particular, our simulations tend to form hundreds of Mars- and Earth-mass objects between 4 and 10 AU. While the merging of some oligarchs may allow them to grow massive enough to form giant planet cores, leftover oligarchs lead to planetary systems that cannot be consistent with our own solar system. We investigate various ideas presented in the literature (including evaporation fronts and planet traps) and find that none easily overcome this tendency toward oligarchic growth.},

abstract = {To date, two planetary systems have been discovered with close-in, terrestrial-mass planets . Many more such discoveries are anticipated in the coming years with radial velocity and transit searches. Here we investigate the different mechanisms that could form `hot Earths' and their observable predictions. Models include: (1) in situ accretion; (2) formation at larger orbital distance followed by inward `type 1' migration; (3) formation from material being `shepherded' inward by a migrating gas giant planet; (4) formation from material being shepherded by moving secular resonances during dispersal of the protoplanetary disc; (5) tidal circularization of eccentric terrestrial planets with close-in perihelion distances and (6) photoevaporative mass-loss of a close-in giant planet. Models 1-4 have been validated in previous work. We show that tidal circularization can form hot Earths, but only for relatively massive planets with very close-in perihelion distances (<~0.025 au), and even then the net inward movement in orbital distance is at most only 0.1-0.15 au. For planets of less than , photoevaporation can remove the planet's envelope and leave behind the solid core on a Gyr time-scale, but only for planets inside 0.025-0.05 au. Using two quantities that are observable by current and upcoming missions, we show that these models each produce unique signatures, and can be observationally distinguished. These observables are the planetary system architecture (detectable with radial velocities, transits and transit timing) and the bulk composition of transiting close-in terrestrial planets (measured by transits via the planet's radius).},

abstract = {Planet formation models suggest the primordial main belt experienced a short but intense period of collisional evolution shortly after the formation of planetary embryos. This period is believed to have lasted until Jupiter reached its full size, when dynamical processes (e.g., sweeping resonances, excitation via planetary embryos) ejected most planetesimals from the main belt zone. The few planetesimals left behind continued to undergo comminution at a reduced rate until the present day. We investigated how this scenario affects the main belt size distribution over Solar System history using a collisional evolution model (CoEM) that accounts for these events. CoEM does not explicitly include results from dynamical models, but instead treats the unknown size of the primordial main belt and the nature/timing of its dynamical depletion using innovative but approximate methods. Model constraints were provided by the observed size frequency distribution of the asteroid belt, the observed population of asteroid families, the cratered surface of differentiated Asteroid (4) Vesta, and the relatively constant crater production rate of the Earth and Moon over the last 3 Gyr. Using CoEM, we solved for both the shape of the initial main belt size distribution after accretion and the asteroid disruption scaling law QD∗. In contrast to previous efforts, we find our derived QD∗ function is very similar to results produced by numerical hydrocode simulations of asteroid impacts. Our best fit results suggest the asteroid belt experienced as much comminution over its early history as it has since it reached its low-mass state approximately 3.9-4.5 Ga. These results suggest the main belt's wavy-shaped size-frequency distribution is a "fossil" from this violent early epoch. We find that most diameter D≳120 km asteroids are primordial, with their physical properties likely determined during the accretion epoch. Conversely, most smaller asteroids are byproducts of fragmentation events. The observed changes in the asteroid spin rate and lightcurve distributions near D˜100-120 km are likely to be a byproduct of this difference. Estimates based on our results imply the primordial main belt population (in the form of D<1000 km bodies) was 150-250 times larger than it is today, in agreement with recent dynamical simulations.},

We describe the evolution of low-mass planets embedded in protoplanetary disks and examine the influence of Lindblad and corotation torques as a function of the disk properties. The role of the disk in causing the evolution of eccentricities and inclinations is also discussed. We describe the rapid migration of intermediate-mass planets that may occur as a runaway process and examine the transition to gap formation and slower migration driven by the viscous evolution of the disk for massive planets. The roles and influence of disk self-gravity and magnetohydrodynamic turbulence are discussed in detail, as a function of the planet mass, as is the evolution of multiple planet systems. Finally, we address the question of how well global models of planetary formation that include migration are able to match observations of extrasolar planets.},

The unprecedented resolution and sensitivity of the GALFA-H I survey have resulted in the detection of numerous isolated, very compact H I clouds at low Galactic velocities, which are distinctly separated from the H I disk emission. In the limited area of ~4600 deg2 surveyed so far, we have detected 96 such compact clouds. The detected clouds are cold with a median T k,max (the kinetic temperature in the case in which there is no non-thermal broadening) of 300 K. Moreover, these clouds are quite compact and faint, with median values of 5 arcmin in angular size, 0.75 K in peak brightness temperature, and 5 × 1018 cm-2 in H I column density. Most of the clouds deviate from Galactic rotation at the 20-30 km s-1 level, and a significant fraction show evidence for a multiphase medium and velocity gradients. No counterparts for these clouds were found in other wave bands. From the modeling of spatial and velocity distributions of the whole compact cloud population, we find that the bulk of the compact clouds are related to the Galactic disk, and their distances are likely to be in the range of 0.1 to a few kpc. We discuss various possible scenarios for the formation and maintenance of this cloud population and its significance for Galactic interstellar medium studies.},

abstract = {The Kepler mission has recently discovered a number of exoplanetary systems, such as Kepler-11 and Kepler-32, in which ensembles of several planets are found in very closely packed orbits (often within a few per cent of an au of one another). These compact configurations present a challenge for traditional planet formation and migration scenarios. We present a dynamical study of the assembly of these systems, using an N-body method which incorporates a parametrized model of planet migration in a turbulent protoplanetary disc. We explore a wide parameter space, and find that under suitable conditions it is possible to form compact, close-packed planetary systems via traditional disc-driven migration. We find that simultaneous migration of multiple planets is a viable mechanism for the assembly of tightly packed planetary systems, as long as the disc provides significant eccentricity damping and the level of turbulence in the disc is modest. We discuss the implications of our preferred parameters for the protoplanetary discs in which these systems formed, and comment on the occurrence and significance of mean-motion resonances in our simulations.},

abstract = {Planetary systems discovered by the Kepler space telescope exhibit an intriguing feature. While the period ratios of adjacent low-mass planets appear largely random, there is a significant excess of pairs that lie just wide of resonances and a deficit on the near side. We demonstrate that this feature naturally arises when two near-resonant planets interact in the presence of weak dissipation that damps eccentricities. The two planets repel each other as orbital energy is lost to heat. This moves near-resonant pairs just beyond resonance, by a distance that reflects the integrated dissipation they experienced over their lifetimes. We find that the observed distances may be explained by tides if tidal dissipation is unexpectedly efficient (tidal quality factor ~10). Once the effect of resonant repulsion is accounted for, the initial orbits of these low-mass planets show little preference for resonances. This could constrain their origin.},

abstract = {Feedback from massive stars is believed to play a critical role in shaping the galaxy mass function, the structure of the interstellar medium (ISM) and the low efficiency of star formation, but the exact form of the feedback is uncertain. In this paper, the first in a series, we present and test a novel numerical implementation of stellar feedback resulting from momentum imparted to the ISM by radiation, supernovae and stellar winds. We employ a realistic cooling function, and find that a large fraction of the gas cools to ≲100 K, so that the ISM becomes highly inhomogeneous. Despite this, our simulated galaxies reach an approximate steady state, in which gas gravitationally collapses to form giant 'molecular' clouds (GMCs), dense clumps and stars; subsequently, stellar feedback disperses the GMCs, repopulating the diffuse ISM. This collapse and dispersal cycle is seen in models of Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC)-like dwarfs, the Milky Way and z˜ 2 clumpy disc analogues. The simulated global star formation efficiencies are consistent with the observed Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. Moreover, the star formation rates are nearly independent of the numerically imposed high-density star formation efficiency, density threshold and density scaling. This is a consequence of the fact that, in our simulations, star formation is regulated by stellar feedback limiting the amount of very dense gas available for forming stars. In contrast, in simulations without stellar feedback, i.e. under the action of only gravity and gravitationally induced turbulence, the ISM experiences runaway collapse to very high densities. In these simulations without feedback, the global star formation rates exceed observed galactic star formation rates by 1-2 orders of magnitude, demonstrating that stellar feedback is crucial to the regulation of star formation in galaxies.},

abstract = {The habitable zones (HZs) of main-sequence stars have traditionally been defined as the range of orbits that intercept the appropriate amount of stellar flux to permit surface water on a planet. Terrestrial exoplanets discovered to orbit M stars in these zones, which are close-in due to decreased stellar luminosity, may also undergo significant tidal heating. Tidal heating may span a wide range for terrestrial exoplanets and may significantly affect conditions near the surface. For example, if heating rates on an exoplanet are near or greater than that on Io (where tides drive volcanism that resurfaces the planet at least every 1 Myr) and produce similar surface conditions, then the development of life seems unlikely. On the other hand, if the tidal heating rate is less than the minimum to initiate plate tectonics, then CO2 may not be recycled through subduction, leading to a runaway greenhouse that sterilizes the planet. These two cases represent potential boundaries to habitability and are presented along with the range of the traditional HZ for main-sequence, low-mass stars. We propose a revised HZ that incorporates both stellar insolation and tidal heating. We apply these criteria to GJ 581 d and find that it is in the traditional HZ, but its tidal heating alone may be insufficient for plate tectonics.},

abstract = {A considerable fraction of multi-planet systems discovered by the observational surveys of extrasolar planets reside in mild proximity to first-order mean-motion resonances. However, the relative remoteness of such systems from nominal resonant period ratios (e.g., 2:1, 3:2, and 4:3) has been interpreted as evidence for lack of resonant interactions. Here, we show that a slow divergence away from exact commensurability is a natural outcome of dissipative evolution and demonstrate that libration of critical angles can be maintained tens of percent away from nominal resonance. We construct an analytical theory for the long-term dynamical evolution of dissipated resonant planetary pairs and confirm our calculations numerically. Collectively, our results suggest that a significant fraction of the near-commensurate extrasolar planets are in fact resonant and have undergone significant dissipative evolution.},

Based on 86 radial velocity observations obtained with the HARPS-N spectrograph on the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo and 32 archival Keck/HIRES observations, we present a precise mass estimate of 4.02+/-0.68 Earth masses. The corresponding high density of 6.88+/-1.18 g/cc is consistent with a rocky composition of primarily iron and magnesium silicate. We compare Kepler-93b to other dense planets with well-constrained parameters and find that between 1-6 Earth masses, all dense planets including the Earth and Venus are well-described by the same fixed ratio of iron to magnesium silicate. There are as of yet no examples of such planets with masses > 6 Earth masses: All known planets in this mass regime have lower densities requiring significant fractions of volatiles or H/He gas. We also constrain the mass and period of the outer companion in the Kepler-93 system from the long-term radial velocity trend and archival adaptive optics images. As the sample of dense planets with well-constrained masses and radii continues to grow, we will be able to test whether the fixed compositional model found for the seven dense planets considered in this paper extends to the full population of 1-6 Earth mass planets.},

abstract = {Context. Radial velocity monitoring of very cool dwarfs such as late M- and hot L-dwarfs has become a promising tool in the search for rocky planets as well as follow-up planetary candidates around dwarfs detected by transit surveys. These stars are faint at optical wavelengths, as their spectral flux distribution peaks at near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths. For this reason, it is desirable to measure the radial velocities in this wavelength regime. However, in the NIR very few medium- and high-resolution spectrographs are available at large telescopes. In the near future, high-resolution spectrographs for the NIR will be built, which will allow us to search for rocky planets around cool M-dwarfs and L-dwarfs from radial velocities monitoring. Aims: We investigate the precision that can be attained in radial velocity measurements of very cool dwarfs in the NIR. The goal is to determine in which atmospheric window of the Earth's atmosphere the highest radial velocity precision can be achieved to help in designing the next generation of NIR high-resolution spectrographs. Methods: We use stellar atmosphere synthetic models for an M- and an L-dwarf with temperatures of 2200 K and 1800 K, respectively, and a theoretical spectrum of the Earth's transmission in the spectral range from 0.9 to 2.5 $\mu$m. We simulate a series of Doppler-shifted spectra observed with different resolving powers and signal-to-noise ratios, and for different rotational broadenings of the dwarf. For different combinations of the input parameters, we recover the radial velocity by means of cross-correlation with a high signal-to-noise ratio template and determine the associate uncertainties. Results: The highest precision in radial velocity measurements for the cool M-dwarf is found in the Y band around 1.0 $\mu$m, while for the L-dwarf it is determined in the J band around 1.25 $\mu$m. We note that synthetic models may lack some faint absorption features or underestimate their abundances. In addition, some instrumental/calibration aspects that are not taken into account in our estimations would increase the uncertainties.},

abstract = {In contrast to the Earth, where frictional heating is typically negligible, we show that drag mechanisms could act as an important heat source in the strongly forced atmospheres of some exoplanets, with the potential to alter the circulation. We modify the standard formalism of the atmospheric energy cycle to explicitly track the loss of kinetic energy and the associated frictional (re)heating, for application to exoplanets such as the asymmetrically heated "hot Jupiters" and gas giants on highly eccentric orbits. We establish that an understanding of the dominant drag mechanisms and their dependence on local atmospheric conditions is critical for accurate modeling, not just in their ability to limit wind speeds, but also because they could possibly change the energetics of the circulation enough to alter the nature of the flow. We discuss possible sources of drag and estimate the strength necessary to significantly influence the atmospheric energetics. As we show, the frictional heating depends on the magnitude of kinetic energy dissipation as well as its spatial variation, so that the more localized a drag mechanism is, the weaker it can be and still affect the circulation. We also use the derived formalism to estimate the rate of numerical loss of kinetic energy in a few previously published hot Jupiter models with and without magnetic drag and find it to be surprisingly large, at 5%-10% of the incident stellar irradiation.},

In this paper we show that this is a natural consequence of a scenario in which cloud-cloud collisions and stellar feedback regulate the internal velocity dispersion of the gas, and so prevent global gravitational forces from becoming dominant. Thus, whilst the molecular gas is for the most part gravitationally unbound, local regions within the denser parts of the gas (within the clouds) do become bound and are able to form stars. We find that the observations, in terms of distributions of virial parameters and cloud structures, can be well modelled provided that the star formation efficiency in these bound regions is of the order of 5-10 per cent. We also find that in this picture the constituent gas of individual molecular clouds changes over relatively short time-scales, typically a few Myr.},

The high angular resolution of Chandra enables us to remove discrete sources and perform spatially resolved spectroscopy for the star-forming regions and associated outflows, allowing us to look at how the physical properties of the hot ISM such as temperature, hydrogen column density, and metal abundances vary throughout these galaxies. We find temperatures of >0.41 keV and 0.85+0.59 -0.12 keV, electron densities of >1.87$\eta$-1/2 × 10-3 cm-3 and 0.21+0.03 -0.04$\eta$-1/2 × 10-3 cm-3, and hot gas masses of >1.1$\eta$1/2 × 107 M sun and ~3.7$\eta$1/2 × 107 M sun in the plane and halo of NGC 4490, respectively, where $\eta$ is the filling factor of the hot gas. The abundance ratios of Ne, Mg, and Si with respect to Fe are found to be consistent with those predicted by theoretical models of type II supernovae (SNe). The thermal energy in the hot ISM is ~5% of the total mechanical energy input from SNe, so it is likely that the hot ISM has been enriched and heated by type II SNe. The X-ray emission is anticorrelated with the H$\alpha$ and mid-infrared emission, suggesting that the hot gas is bounded by filaments of cooler ionized hydrogen mixed with warm dust.},

abstract = {Context. This study deals with infrared bubbles, the H ii regions they enclose, and triggered massive-star formation on their borders. Aims: We attempt to determine the nature of the bubbles observed by Spitzer in the Galactic plane, mainly to establish if possible their association with massive stars. We take advantage of the very simple morphology of these objects to search for star formation triggered by H ii regions, and to estimate the importance of this mode of star formation. Methods: We consider a sample of 102 bubbles detected by Spitzer-GLIMPSE, and catalogued by Churchwell et al. (2006; hereafter CH06). We use mid-infrared and radio-continuum public data (respectively the Spitzer-GLIMPSE and -MIPSGAL surveys and the MAGPIS and VGPS surveys) to discuss their nature. We use the ATLASGAL survey at 870 $\mu$m to search for dense neutral material collected on their borders. The 870 $\mu$m data traces the distribution of cold dust, thus of the dense neutral material where stars may form. Results: We find that 86% of the bubbles contain ionized gas detected by means of its radio-continuum emission at 20-cm. Thus, most of the bubbles observed at 8.0 $\mu$m enclose H ii regions ionized by O-B2 stars. This finding differs from the earlier CH06 results (~25% of the bubbles enclosing H ii regions). Ninety-eight percent of the bubbles exhibit 24 $\mu$m emission in their central regions. The ionized regions at the center of the 8.0 $\mu$m bubbles seem to be devoid of PAHs but contain hot dust. PAH emission at 8.0 $\mu$m is observed in the direction of the photodissociation regions surrounding the ionized gas. Among the 65 regions for which the angular resolution of the observations is high enough to resolve the spatial distribution of cold dust at 870 $\mu$m, we find that 40% are surrounded by cold dust, and that another 28% contain interacting condensations. The former are good candidates for the collect and collapse process, as they display an accumulation of dense material at their borders. The latter are good candidates for the compression of pre-existing condensations by the ionized gas. Thirteen bubbles exhibit associated ultracompact H ii regions in the direction of dust condensations adjacent to their ionization fronts. Another five show methanol masers in similar condensations. Conclusions: Our results suggest that more than a quarter of the bubbles may have triggered the formation of massive objects. Therefore, star formation triggered by H ii regions may be an important process, especially for massive-star formation. Appendices are only available in electronic form at http://www.aanda.org},

abstract = {The c2d Spitzer Legacy project obtained images and photometry with both IRAC and MIPS instruments for five large, nearby molecular clouds. Three of the clouds were also mapped in dust continuum emission at 1.1 mm, and optical spectroscopy has been obtained for some clouds. This paper combines information drawn from studies of individual clouds into a combined and updated statistical analysis of star-formation rates and efficiencies, numbers and lifetimes for spectral energy distribution (SED) classes, and clustering properties. Current star-formation efficiencies range from 3% to 6%; if star formation continues at current rates for 10 Myr, efficiencies could reach 15-30%. Star-formation rates and rates per unit area vary from cloud to cloud; taken together, the five clouds are producing about 260 M sun of stars per Myr. The star-formation surface density is more than an order of magnitude larger than would be predicted from the Kennicutt relation used in extragalactic studies, reflecting the fact that those relations apply to larger scales, where more diffuse matter is included in the gas surface density. Measured against the dense gas probed by the maps of dust continuum emission, the efficiencies are much higher, with stellar masses similar to masses of dense gas, and the current stock of dense cores would be exhausted in 1.8 Myr on average. Nonetheless, star formation is still slow compared to that expected in a free-fall time, even in the dense cores. The derived lifetime for the Class I phase is 0.54 Myr, considerably longer than some estimates. Similarly, the lifetime for the Class 0 SED class, 0.16 Myr, with the notable exception of the Ophiuchus cloud, is longer than early estimates. If photometry is corrected for estimated extinction before calculating class indicators, the lifetimes drop to 0.44 Myr for Class I and to 0.10 for Class 0. These lifetimes assume a continuous flow through the Class II phase and should be considered median lifetimes or half-lives. Star formation is highly concentrated to regions of high extinction, and the youngest objects are very strongly associated with dense cores. The great majority (90%) of young stars lie within loose clusters with at least 35 members and a stellar density of 1 M sun pc-3. Accretion at the sound speed from an isothermal sphere over the lifetime derived for the Class I phase could build a star of about 0.25 M sun, given an efficiency of 0.3. Building larger mass stars by using higher mass accretion rates could be problematic, as our data confirm and aggravate the "luminosity problem" for protostars. At a given T bol, the values for L bol are mostly less than predicted by standard infall models and scatter over several orders of magnitude. These results strongly suggest that accretion is time variable, with prolonged periods of very low accretion. Based on a very simple model and this sample of sources, half the mass of a star would be accreted during only 7% of the Class I lifetime, as represented by the eight most luminous objects.},

abstract = {We report the distribution of planets as a function of planet radius, orbital period, and stellar effective temperature for orbital periods less than 50 days around solar-type (GK) stars. These results are based on the 1235 planets (formally "planet candidates") from the Kepler mission that include a nearly complete set of detected planets as small as 2 R ⊕. For each of the 156,000 target stars, we assess the detectability of planets as a function of planet radius, R p, and orbital period, P, using a measure of the detection efficiency for each star. We also correct for the geometric probability of transit, R sstarf/a. We consider first Kepler target stars within the "solar subset" having T eff = 4100-6100 K, log g = 4.0-4.9, and Kepler magnitude Kp < 15 mag, i.e., bright, main-sequence GK stars. We include only those stars having photometric noise low enough to permit detection of planets down to 2 R ⊕. We count planets in small domains of R p and P and divide by the included target stars to calculate planet occurrence in each domain. The resulting occurrence of planets varies by more than three orders of magnitude in the radius-orbital period plane and increases substantially down to the smallest radius (2 R ⊕) and out to the longest orbital period (50 days, ~0.25 AU) in our study. For P < 50 days, the distribution of planet radii is given by a power law, df/dlog R = kRR $\alpha$ with kR = 2.9+0.5 - 0.4, $\alpha$ = -1.92 $\pm$ 0.11, and R ≡ R p/R ⊕. This rapid increase in planet occurrence with decreasing planet size agrees with the prediction of core-accretion formation but disagrees with population synthesis models that predict a desert at super-Earth and Neptune sizes for close-in orbits. Planets with orbital periods shorter than 2 days are extremely rare; for R p > 2 R ⊕ we measure an occurrence of less than 0.001 planets per star. For all planets with orbital periods less than 50 days, we measure occurrence of 0.130 $\pm$ 0.008, 0.023 $\pm$ 0.003, and 0.013 $\pm$ 0.002 planets per star for planets with radii 2-4, 4-8, and 8-32 R ⊕, in agreement with Doppler surveys. We fit occurrence as a function of P to a power-law model with an exponential cutoff below a critical period P 0. For smaller planets, P 0 has larger values, suggesting that the "parking distance" for migrating planets moves outward with decreasing planet size. We also measured planet occurrence over a broader stellar T eff range of 3600-7100 K, spanning M0 to F2 dwarfs. Over this range, the occurrence of 2-4 R ⊕ planets in the Kepler field increases with decreasing T eff, with these small planets being seven times more abundant around cool stars (3600-4100 K) than the hottest stars in our sample (6600-7100 K). Based in part on observations obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated by the University of California and the California Institute of Technology.},

abstract = {There is growing observational evidence that disk evolution is stellar-mass-dependent. Here, we show that these dependencies extend to the atomic and molecular content of disk atmospheres. We analyze a unique dataset of high-resolution Spitzer/IRS spectra from eight very low mass star and brown dwarf disks. We report the first detections of Ne+, H2, CO2, and tentative detections of H2O toward these faint and low-mass disks. Two of our [Ne II] 12.81 $\mu$m emission lines likely trace the hot (>=5000 K) disk surface irradiated by X-ray photons from the central stellar/sub-stellar object. The H2 S(2) and S(1) fluxes are consistent with arising below the fully or partially ionized surface traced by the [Ne II] emission in gas at ~600 K. We confirm the higher C2H2/HCN flux and column density ratio in brown dwarf disks previously noted from low-resolution IRS spectra. Our high-resolution spectra also show that the HCN/H2O fluxes of brown dwarf disks are on average higher than those of T Tauri disks. Our LTE modeling hints that this difference extends to column density ratios if H2O lines trace warm >=600 K disk gas. These trends suggest that the inner regions of brown dwarf disks have a lower O/C ratio than those of T Tauri disks, which may result from a more efficient formation of non-migrating icy planetesimals. An O/C = 1, as inferred from our analysis, would have profound implications on the bulk composition of rocky planets that can form around very low mass stars and brown dwarfs.},

abstract = {The statistics of extrasolar planetary systems indicate that the default mode of planet formation generates planets with orbital periods shorter than 100 days, and masses substantially exceeding that of the Earth. When viewed in this context, the Solar System is unusual. Here, we present simulations which show that a popular formation scenario for Jupiter and Saturn, in which Jupiter migrates inward from a > 5 AU to a ~ 1.5 AU before reversing direction, can explain the low overall mass of the Solar System's terrestrial planets, as well as the absence of planets with a < 0.4 AU. Jupiter's inward migration entrained s ~ 10-100 km planetesimals into low-order mean-motion resonances, shepherding and exciting their orbits. The resulting collisional cascade generated a planetesimal disk that, evolving under gas drag, would have driven any pre-existing short-period planets into the Sun.

abstract = {We have recently carried out spectral synthesis modeling to determine Teff, log g, v sin i, and [Fe/H] for 1040 FGK-type stars on the Keck, Lick, and Anglo-Australian Telescope planet search programs. This is the first time that a single, uniform spectroscopic analysis has been made for every star on a large Doppler planet search survey. We identify a subset of 850 stars that have Doppler observations sufficient to detect uniformly all planets with radial velocity semiamplitudes K > 30 m s-1 and orbital periods shorter than 4 yr. From this subset of stars, we determine that fewer than 3% of stars with -0.5 < [Fe/H] < 0.0 have Doppler-detected planets. Above solar metallicity, there is a smooth and rapid rise in the fraction of stars with planets. At [Fe/H] > +0.3 dex, 25% of observed stars have detected gas giant planets. A power-law fit to these data relates the formation probability for gas giant planets to the square of the number of metal atoms. High stellar metallicity also appears to be correlated with the presence of multiple-planet systems and with the total detected planet mass. This data set was examined to better understand the origin of high metallicity in stars with planets. None of the expected fossil signatures of accretion are observed in stars with planets relative to the general sample: (1) metallicity does not appear to increase as the mass of the convective envelopes decreases, (2) subgiants with planets do not show dilution of metallicity, (3) no abundance variations for Na, Si, Ti, or Ni are found as a function of condensation temperature, and (4) no correlations between metallicity and orbital period or eccentricity could be identified. We conclude that stars with extrasolar planets do not have an accretion signature that distinguishes them from other stars; more likely, they are simply born in higher metallicity molecular clouds.},

abstract = {This paper examines how type I planetary migration is affected by the presence of turbulent density fluctuations in the circumstellar disk. For type I migration, the planet does not clear a gap in the disk and its secular motion is driven by torques generated by the wakes it creates in the surrounding disk fluid. MHD turbulence creates additional density perturbations that gravitationally interact with the planet and can dominate the torques that stem from the protoplanetary wake. This paper shows that conventional type I migration can be readily overwhelmed by turbulent perturbations, and hence the usual description of type I migration should be modified in locations where the magnetorotational instability is active. In general, the migrating planet does not follow a smooth inward trend but rather exhibits a random walk through phase space. Our main conclusion is that MHD turbulence will alter the timescales for type I planetary migration and, because of chaos, requires the timescales to be described by a distribution of values.},

abstract = {The tidal torque exerted by a protoplanetary disk with power-law surface density and temperature profiles onto an embedded protoplanetary embryo is generally a negative quantity that leads to the embryo inward migration. Here we investigate how the tidal torque balance is affected at a disk surface density radial jump. The jump has two consequences: (1) It affects the differential Lindblad torque. In particular, if the disk is merely empty on the inner side, the differential Lindblad torque almost amounts to the large negative outer Lindblad torque. (2) It affects the corotation torque, which is a quantity very sensitive to the local gradient of the disk surface density. In particular, if the disk is depleted on the inside and the jump occurs radially over a few pressure scale heights, the corotation torque is a positive quantity that is much larger than in a power-law disk. We show by means of customized numerical simulations of low-mass planets embedded in protoplanetary nebulae with a surface density jump that the second effect is dominant; that is, that the corotation torque largely dominates the differential Lindblad torque on the edge of a central depletion, even a shallow one. Namely, a disk surface density jump of about 50% over 3-5 disk thicknesses suffices to cancel out the total torque. As a consequence, the type I migration of low-mass objects reaching the jump should be halted, and all these objects should be trapped there provided some amount of dissipation is present in the disk to prevent the corotation torque saturation. As dissipation is provided by turbulence, which induces a jitter of the planet semimajor axis, we investigate under which conditions the trapping process overcomes the trend of turbulence to induce stochastic migration across the disk. We show that a cavity with a large outer to inner surface density ratio efficiently traps embryos from 1 to 15 M⊕, at any radius up to 5 AU from the central object, in a disk that has same surface density profile as the minimum mass solar nebula (MMSN). Shallow surface density transitions require light disks to efficiently trap embryos. In the case of the MMSN, this could happen in the very central parts (r < 0.03 AU). We discuss where in a protoplanetary disk one can expect a surface density jump. This effect could constitute a solution to the well-known problem that the buildup of the first protogiant solid core in a disk takes much longer than its type I migration toward the central object.},

abstract = {The solar photosphere is depleted in refractory elements compared to most solar twins, with the degree of depletion increasing with an element's condensation temperature. Here, I show that adding 4 Earth masses of Earth-like and carbonaceous-chondrite-like material to the solar convection zone brings the Sun's composition into line with the mean value for the solar twins. The observed solar composition could have arisen if the Sun's convection zone accreted material from the solar nebula that was depleted in refractory elements due to the formation of the terrestrial planets and ejection of rocky protoplanets from the asteroid belt. Most solar analogs are missing 0-10 Earth masses of rocky material compared to the most refractory-rich stars, providing an upper limit to the mass of rocky terrestrial planets that they possess. The missing mass is correlated with stellar metallicity. This suggests that the efficiency of planetesimal formation increases with stellar metallicity. Stars with and without known giant planets show a similar distribution of abundance trends. If refractory depletion is a signature of the presence of terrestrial planets, this suggests that there is not a strong correlation between the presence of terrestrial and giant planets in the same system.},

abstract = {The discovery of the chaotic behavior of the planetary orbits in the Solar System [Laskar, J., 1989. Nature 338, 237-238; Laskar, J., 1990. Icarus 88, 266-291] was obtained using numerical integration of averaged equations. In [Laskar, J., 1994. Astron. Astrophys. 287, L9-L12], these same equations are integrated over several Gyr and show the evidence of very large possible increase of the eccentricity of Mercury through chaotic diffusion. On the other hand, in the direct numerical integration of Ito and Tanikawa [Ito, T., Tanikawa, K., 2002. Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc. 336, 483-500] performed without general relativity over $\pm$4 Gyr, the eccentricity of Mercury presented some chaotic diffusion, but with a maximal excursion smaller than about 0.35. In the present work, a statistical analysis is performed over more than 1001 different integrations of the secular equations over 5 Gyr. This allows to obtain for each planet, the probability for the eccentricity to reach large values. In particular, we obtain that the probability of the eccentricity of Mercury to increase beyond 0.6 in 5 Gyr is about 1 to 2%, which is relatively large. In order to compare with Ito and Tanikawa [Ito, T., Tanikawa, K., 2002. Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc. 336, 483-500], we have performed the same analysis without general relativity, and obtained even more orbits of large eccentricity for Mercury. In order to clarify these differences, we have performed as well a direct integration of the planetary orbits, without averaging, for a dynamical model that do not include the Moon or general relativity with 10 very close initial conditions over 3 Gyr. The statistics obtained with this reduced set are comparable to the statistics of the secular equations, and in particular we obtain two trajectories for which the eccentricity of Mercury increases beyond 0.8 in less than 1.3 and 2.8 Gyr, respectively. These strong instabilities in the orbital motion of Mercury results from secular resonance between the perihelion of Jupiter and Mercury that are facilitated by the absence of general relativity. The statistical analysis of the 1001 orbits of the secular equations also provides probability density functions (PDF) for the eccentricity and inclination of the terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, the Earth and Mars) that are very well approximated by Rice PDF. This provides a very simple representation of the planetary PDF over 5 Gyr. On this time-scale the evolution of the PDF of the terrestrial planets is found to be similar to the one of a diffusive process. As shown in Laskar [Laskar, J., 1994. Astron. Astrophys. 287, L9-L12], the outer planets orbital elements do not present significant diffusion, and the PDFs of their eccentricities and inclinations are well represented by the PDF of quasiperiodic motions with a few periodic terms.},

abstract = {Super-Earths, objects slightly larger than Earth and slightly smaller than Uranus, have found a special place in exoplanetary science. As a new class of planetary bodies, these objects have challenged models of planet formation at both ends of the spectrum and have triggered a great deal of research on the composition and interior dynamics of rocky planets in connection to their masses and radii. Being relatively easier to detect than an Earth-sized planet at 1 AU around a G star, super-Earths have become the focus of worldwide observational campaigns to search for habitable planets. With a range of masses that allows these objects to retain moderate atmospheres and perhaps even plate tectonics, super-Earths may be habitable if they maintain long-term orbits in the habitable zones of their host stars. Given that in the past two years a few such potentially habitable super-Earths have in fact been discovered, it is necessary to develop a deep understanding of the formation and dynamical evolution of these ...},

abstract = {Using the cumulative catalog of planets detected by the NASA Kepler mission, we reconstruct the intrinsic occurrence of Earth- to Neptune-size (1-4 R ⊕) planets and their distributions with radius and orbital period. We analyze 76,711 solar-type (0.8 < R */R ⊙ < 1.2) stars with 430 planets on 20-200 day orbits, excluding close-in planets that may have been affected by the proximity to the host star. Our analysis considers errors in planet radii and includes an "iterative simulation" technique that does not bin the data. We find a radius distribution that peaks at 2-2.8 Earth radii, with lower numbers of smaller and larger planets. These planets are uniformly distributed with logarithmic period, and the mean number of such planets per star is 0.46 $\pm$ 0.03. The occurrence is ~0.66 if planets interior to 20 days are included. We estimate the occurrence of Earth-size planets in the "habitable zone" (defined as 1-2 R ⊕, 0.99-1.7 AU for solar-twin stars) as 6.4+3.4-1.1 %. Our results largely agree with those of Petigura et al., although we find a higher occurrence of 2.8-4 Earth-radii planets. The reasons for this excess are the inclusion of errors in planet radius, updated Huber et al. stellar parameters, and also the exclusion of planets that may have been affected by proximity to the host star.},

We find that among protoplanets, larger ones grow more slowly than smaller ones, while the growth of protoplanets is still faster than that of planetesimals. As a result, in the stage after rapid runaway growth, protoplanets with the same order mass grow oligarchically, while most planetesimals remain small. While the protoplanets grow, orbital repulsion keeps their orbital separations wider than about 5 Hill radius of the protoplanets. The typical orbital separation is about 10 Hill radius, which only weakly depends on the mass and the semimajor axis of protoplanets. We explain how this self-organized protoplanet-planetesimal system forms.},

abstract = {We report on the orbital architectures of Kepler systems having multiple-planet candidates identified in the analysis of data from the first six quarters of Kepler data and reported by Batalha et al. (2013). These data show 899 transiting planet candidates in 365 multiple-planet systems and provide a powerful means to study the statistical properties of planetary systems. Using a generic mass-radius relationship, we find that only two pairs of planets in these candidate systems (out of 761 pairs total) appear to be on Hill-unstable orbits, indicating ~96% of the candidate planetary systems are correctly interpreted as true systems. We find that planet pairs show little statistical preference to be near mean-motion resonances. We identify an asymmetry in the distribution of period ratios near first-order resonances (e.g., 2:1, 3:2), with an excess of planet pairs lying wide of resonance and relatively few lying narrow of resonance. Finally, based upon the transit duration ratios of adjacent planets in each system, we find that the interior planet tends to have a smaller transit impact parameter than the exterior planet does. This finding suggests that the mode of the mutual inclinations of planetary orbital planes is in the range 1.$\,^{\circ}$0-2.$\,^{\circ}$2, for the packed systems of small planets probed by these observations.},

abstract = {Context. The recent results of the HARPS and Kepler surveys provided us with a bounty of extrasolar systems. While the two teams extensively analyzed each of their data-sets, little work has been done comparing the two. Aims: We study a subset of the planetary population whose characterization is simultaneously within reach of both instruments. We compare the statistical properties of planets in systems with msini > 5-10 M⊕ and R > 2 R⊕, as inferred from the HARPS and Kepler surveys, respectively. If we assume that the underlying population has the same characteristics, the different detection sensitivity to the orbital inclination relative to the line of sight allows us to probe the planets' mutual inclination. Methods: We considered the frequency of systems with one, two, and three planets as dictated by HARPS data. We used Kepler's planetary period and host mass and radius distributions (corrected from detection bias) to model planetary systems in a simple, yet physically plausible way. We then varied the mutual inclination between planets in a system according to different prescriptions (completely aligned, Rayleigh distributions, and isotropic) and compared the transit frequencies with one, two, or three planets with those measured by Kepler. Results: The results show that the two datasets are compatible, a remarkable result especially because there are no tunable knobs other than the assumed inclination distribution. For msini cutoffs of 7-10 M⊕, which are those expected to correspond to the radius cutoff of 2 R⊕, we conclude that the results are better described by a Rayleigh distribution with a mode of 1$\,^{\circ}$ or smaller. We show that the best-fit scenario only becomes a Rayleigh distribution with a mode of 5$\,^{\circ}$ if we assume a quite extreme mass-radius relationship for the planetary population. Conclusions: These results have important consequences for our understanding of the role of several proposed formation and evolution mechanisms. They confirm that planets are likely to have been formed in a disk and show that most planetary systems evolve quietly without strong angular momentum exchanges such as those produced by Kozai mechanism or planet scattering.},

abstract = {Most of the carbon in carbonaceous chondrites is organic material that displays structures as diverse as kerogen-like macromolecules and simpler soluble compounds ranging from polar amino acids and polyols to nonpolar hydrocarbons. Overall, the large molecular and isotopic diversity of meteorite organics verifies their extraterrestrial origin and points to synthetic pathways in a variety of chemical regimes. These include exothermic reactions in the cold, H-fractionating interstellar gas phase and aqueous reactions in asteroidal parent bodies. Reactions on interstellar grains and during nebular processes were most likely involved but are inferred with less certainty. The unique L-asymmetry of some meteoritic amino acids suggests their possible contribution to terrestrial molecular evolution. Many interplanetary dust particles show a primitive composition that distinguishes them from known meteorites and could offer unique insights into unaltered nebular material. So far, micrometer sizes have prevented their wide-ranging molecular characterization.},

abstract = {Unlike gas-giant planets, we lack examples of terrestrial planets orbiting other Sun-like stars to help us understand how they formed. We can draw hints from elsewhere though. Astronomical observations of young stars; the chemical and isotopic compositions of Earth, Mars and meteorites; and the structure of the Solar System all provide clues to how the inner rocky planets formed. These data have inspired and helped to refine a widely accepted model for terrestrial planet formation-the planetesimal hypothesis. In this model, the young Sun is surrounded by a disk of gas and fine dust grains. Grains stick together to form mountain-size bodies called planetesimals. Collisions and gravitational interactions between planetesimals combine to produce a few tens of Moon-to-Mars-size planetary embryos in roughly 0.1-1 million years. Finally, the embryos collide to form the planets in 10-100 million years. One of these late collisions probably led to the formation of Earth's Moon. This basic sequence of events is clear, but a number of issues are unresolved. In particular, we do not really understand the physics of planetesimal formation, or how the planets came to have their present chemical compositions. We do not know why Mars is so much smaller than Earth, or exactly what prevented a planet from forming in the asteroid belt. Progress is being made in all of these areas, although definitive answers may have to wait for observations of Earth-like planets orbiting other stars.},

This study examines planet occurrence rates for the Kepler GK dwarf target sample for planet radii, 0.75<Rp<2.5 Rearth, and orbital periods, 50<Porb<300 days, with an emphasis on a thorough exploration and identification of the most important sources of systematic uncertainties. Integrating over this parameter space, we measure an occurrence rate of F=0.77 planets per star, with an allowed range of 0.3<F<1.9. The allowed range takes into account both statistical and systematic uncertainties, and values of F beyond the allowed range are significantly in disagreement with our analysis. We generally find higher planet occurrence rates and a steeper increase in planet occurrence rates towards small planets than previous studies of the Kepler GK dwarf sample. Through extrapolation, we find that the one year orbital period terrestrial planet occurrence rate, zeta_1=0.1, with an allowed range of 0.01<zeta_1<2, where zeta_1 is defined as the number of planets per star within 20% of the Rp and Porb of Earth. For G dwarf hosts, the zeta_1 parameter space is a subset of the larger eta_earth parameter space, thus zeta_1 places a lower limit on eta_earth for G dwarf hosts. From our analysis, we identify the leading sources of systematics impacting Kepler occurrence rate determinations as: reliability of the planet candidate sample, planet radii, pipeline completeness, and stellar parameters.},

abstract = {We describe a coagulation model that leads to the rapid formation of super-Earths and the cores of gas giant planets. Interaction of collision fragments with the gaseous disk is the crucial element of this model. The gas entrains small collision fragments, which rapidly settle to the disk midplane. Protoplanets accrete the fragments and grow to masses 1 M ⊕ in ~ 1 Myr. Our model explains the mass distribution of planets in the solar system and predicts that super-Earths form more frequently than gas giants in low-mass disks.},

abstract = {Context: With the high number of extrasolar planets discovered by now, it has become possible to use the properties of this planetary population to constrain theoretical formation models in a statistical sense. This paper is the first in a series in which we carry out a large number of planet population synthesis calculations within the framework of the core accretion scenario. We begin the series with a paper mainly dedicated to the presentation of our approach, but also the discussion of a representative synthetic planetary population of solar like stars. In the second paper we statistically compare the subset of detectable planets to the actual extrasolar planets. In subsequent papers, we shall extend the range of stellar masses and the properties of protoplanetary disks. Aims: The last decade has seen a large observational progress in characterizing both protoplanetary disks, and extrasolar planets. Concurrently, progress was made in developing complex theoretical formation models. The combination of these three developments allows a new kind of study: the synthesis of a population of planets from a model, which is compared with the actual population. Our aim is to obtain a general overview of the population, to check if we quantitatively reproduce the most important observed properties and correlations, and to make predictions about the planets that are not yet observable. Methods: Based as tightly as possible on observational data, we have derived probability distributions for the most important initial conditions for the planetary formation process. We then draw sets of initial conditions from these distributions and obtain the corresponding synthetic planets with our formation model. By repeating this step many times, we synthesize the populations. Results: Although the main purpose of this paper is the description of our methods, we present some key results: we find that the variation of the initial conditions in the limits occurring in nature leads to the formation of planets of wide diversity. This formation process is best visualized in planetary formation tracks in the mass-semimajor axis diagram, where different phases of concurrent growth and migration can be identified. These phases lead to the emergence of sub-populations of planets distinguishable in a mass-semimajor axis diagram. The most important ones are the ``failed cores'', a vast group of core-dominated low mass planets, the ``horizontal branch'', a sub-population of Neptune mass planets extending out to 6 AU, and the ``main clump'', a concentration of giant gaseous planets at around 0.3-2 AU.},

abstract = {Extrasolar super-Earths (1-10 M ⊕) are likely to exist with a wide range of atmospheres. Some super-Earths may be able to retain massive hydrogen-rich atmospheres. Others might never accumulate hydrogen or experience significant escape of lightweight elements, resulting in atmospheres more like those of the terrestrial planets in our solar system. We examine how an observer could differentiate between hydrogen-rich and hydrogen-poor atmospheres by modeling super-Earth emission and transmission spectra, and we find that discrimination is possible by observing the transmission spectrum alone. An Earth-like atmosphere, composed of mostly heavy elements and molecules, will have a very weak transmission signal due to its small atmospheric scale height (since the scale height is inversely proportional to molecular weight). However, a large hydrogen-rich atmosphere reveals a relatively large transmission signal. The super-Earth emission spectrum can additionally constrain the atmospheric composition and temperature structure. Super-Earths with massive hydrogen atmospheres will reveal strong spectral features due to water, whereas those that have lost most of their hydrogen (and have no liquid ocean) will be marked by CO2 features and a lack of H2O. We apply our study specifically to the low-mass planet orbiting an M star, Gl 581c (Msin i = 5 M ⊕), although our conclusions are relevant for super-Earths in general. The ability to distinguish hydrogen-rich atmospheres might be essential for interpreting mass and radius observations of planets in the transition between rocky super-Earths and Neptune-like planets.},

abstract = {The rheological properties of the mantle of super-Earths have important influences on their orbital and thermal evolution. Mineral physics observations are reviewed to obtain some insights into the rheological properties of deep mantles of these planets where pressure can be as high as similar to 1 TPa. It is shown that, in contrast to a conventional view that the viscosity of a solid increases with pressure (at a fixed temperature), viscosity will decrease with pressure (and depth) when pressure exceeds similar to 0.1 TPa. The causes for pressure-weakening include: (i) the transition in diffusion mechanisms from vacancy to interstitial mechanism (at similar to 0.1 TPa), (ii) the phase transition in MgO from B1 to B2 structure (at similar to 0.5 TPa), (iii) the dissociation of MgSiO3 into MgO and SiO2 (at similar to 1 TPa), and (iv) the transition to the metallic state (at similar to 1 TPa). Some (or all) of them individually or in combination reduce the effective viscosity of constituent materials in the deep interior of super-Earths. Taken together, super-Earths are likely to have low viscosity deep mantle by at least 2-3 orders of magnitude less than the maximum viscosity in the lower mantle of Earth. Because viscosity likely decreases with pressure above similar to 0.1 TPa (in addition to higher temperatures for larger planets), deep mantle viscosity of super-Earths will decrease with increasing planetary mass. The inferred low viscosity of the deep mantle results in high tidal dissipation and resultant rapid orbital evolution, and affects thermal history and hence generation of the magnetic field and the style of mantle convection.

abstract = {We use the COMPLETE Survey's observations of the Perseus star-forming region to assess and intercompare the three methods used for measuring column density in molecular clouds: near-infrared (NIR) extinction mapping; thermal emission mapping in the far-IR; and mapping the intensity of CO isotopologues. Overall, the structures shown by all three tracers are morphologically similar, but important differences exist among the tracers. We find that the dust-based measures (NIR extinction and thermal emission) give similar, log-normal, distributions for the full (~20 pc scale) Perseus region, once careful calibration corrections are made. We also compare dust- and gas-based column density distributions for physically meaningful subregions of Perseus, and we find significant variations in the distributions for those (smaller, ~few pc scale) regions. Even though we have used 12CO data to estimate excitation temperatures, and we have corrected for opacity, the 13CO maps seem unable to give column distributions that consistently resemble those from dust measures. We have edited out the effects of the shell around the B-star HD 278942 from the column density distribution comparisons. In that shell's interior and in the parts where it overlaps the molecular cloud, there appears to be a dearth of 13CO, which is likely due either to 13CO not yet having had time to form in this young structure and/or destruction of 13CO in the molecular cloud by the HD 278942's wind and/or radiation. We conclude that the use of either dust or gas measures of column density without extreme attention to calibration (e.g., of thermal emission zero-levels) and artifacts (e.g., the shell) is more perilous than even experts might normally admit. And, the use of 13CO data to trace total column density in detail, even after proper calibration, is unavoidably limited in utility due to threshold, depletion, and opacity effects. If one's main aim is to map column density (rather than temperature or kinematics), then dust extinction seems the best probe, up to a limiting extinction caused by a dearth of sufficient background sources. Linear fits among all three tracers' estimates of column density are given, allowing us to quantify the inherent uncertainties in using one tracer, in comparison with the others.},

abstract = {An up-to-date, comprehensive account of major issues in finite mixture modeling This volume provides an up-to-date account of the theory and applications of modeling via finite mixture distributions. With an emphasis on the applications of mixture models in both mainstream analysis and other areas such as unsupervised pattern recognition, speech recognition, and medical imaging, the book describes the formulations of the finite mixture approach, details its methodology, discusses aspects of its implementation, and illustrates its application in many common statistical contexts. Major issues discussed in this book include identifiability problems, actual fitting of finite mixtures through use of the EM algorithm, properties of the maximum likelihood estimators so obtained, assessment of the number of components to be used in the mixture, and the applicability of asymptotic theory in providing a basis for the solutions to some of these problems. The author also considers how the EM algorithm can be scaled to handle the fitting of mixture models to very large databases, as in data mining applications. This comprehensive, practical guide: * Provides more than 800 references-40% published since 1995 * Includes an appendix listing available mixture software * Links statistical literature with machine learning and pattern recognition literature * Contains more than 100 helpful graphs, charts, and tables Finite Mixture Models is an important resource for both applied and theoretical statisticians as well as for researchers in the many areas in which finite mixture models can be used to analyze data.},

abstract = {The Lick Planet Search program began in 1987 when the first spectrum of $\tau$ Ceti was taken with an iodine cell and the Hamilton Spectrograph. Upgrades to the instrument improved the Doppler precision from about 10 m s-1 in 1992 to about 3 m s-1 in 1995. The project detected dozens of exoplanets with orbital periods ranging from a few days to several years. The Lick survey identified the first planet in an eccentric orbit (70 Virginis) and the first multi-planet system around a normal main sequence star (Upsilon Andromedae). These discoveries advanced our understanding of planet formation and orbital migration. Data from this project helped to quantify a correlation between host star metallicity and the occurrence rate of gas giant planets. The program also served as a test bed for innovation with testing of a tip-tilt system at the Coud{\'e} focus and fiber scrambler designs to stabilize illumination of the spectrometer optics. The Lick Planet Search with the Hamilton Spectrograph effectively ended when a heater malfunction compromised the integrity of the iodine cell. Here, we present more than 14,000 velocities for 386 stars that were surveyed between 1987 and 2011. Based on observations obtained at the Lick Observatory, which is operated by the University of California.},

To explore hot atmospheres above 1000 K, we model the vaporization of silicate magma and estimate the range of atmospheric compositions according to the planet's radius and semi-major axis for the Kepler 2011 February data release. Our results show five atmospheric types for hot, rocky super-Earth atmospheres, strongly dependent on the initial composition and the planet's distance to the star. We provide a simple set of parameters that can be used to evaluate atmospheric compositions for current and future candidates provided by the Kepler mission and other searches.},

abstract = {New observations at high latitudes above the H II region W4 show that the structure formerly identified as a chimney candidate, an opening to the Galactic halo, is instead a superbubble in the process of fragmenting and possibly evolving into a chimney. Data at high Galactic latitudes (b>5deg) above the W3/W4 star-forming region at 1420 and 408 MHz Stokes I (total power) and 1420 MHz Stokes Q and U (linear polarization) reveal an egg-shaped structure with morphological correlations between our data and the H$\alpha$ data of Dennison, Topasna, and Simonetti. Polarized intensity images show depolarization extending from W4 up the walls of the superbubble, providing strong evidence that the radio continuum is generated by thermal emission coincident with the H$\alpha$ emission regions. We conclude that the parts of the H II region hitherto known as W4 and the newly revealed thermal emission are all ionized by the open cluster OCl 352. At an assumed distance of 2.35 kpc, the ovoid structure is 164 pc wide and extends 246 pc above the midplane of the Galaxy. The shell's emission decreases in total intensity and polarized intensity in various locations, appearing to have a break at its top and another on one side. Using a geometric analysis of the depolarization in the shell's walls, we estimate that a magnetic field line-of-sight component of 3-5 $\mu$G exists in the shell. We explore the connection between W4 and the Galactic halo, considering whether sufficient radiation can escape from the fragmenting superbubble to ionize the kiloparsec-scale H$\alpha$ loop discovered by Reynolds, Sterling and Haffner.},

abstract = {The research of exoplanets has entered an era in which we characterize extrasolar planets. This has become possible with measurements of radii and luminosities. Meanwhile, radial velocity surveys discover also very low-mass planets. Uniting all this observational data into one coherent picture to better understand planet formation is an important, but difficult undertaking. Our approach is to develop a model which can make testable predictions for all these observational methods. We continue to describe how we have extended our formation model into a self-consistently coupled formation and evolution model. We show how we calculate the internal structure of the solid core and radiogenic heating. We also improve the protoplanetary disk model. Finally, we conduct population synthesis calculations. We present how the planetary mass-radius relationship of planets with primordial H/He envelopes forms and evolves in time. The basic shape of the M-R relation can be understood from the core accretion model. Low-mass planets cannot bind massive envelopes, while super-critical cores necessarily trigger runway gas accretion, leading to "forbidden" zones in the M-R plane. For a given mass, there is a considerable diversity of radii. We compare the synthetic M-R relation with the observed one, finding good agreement for a>0.1 AU. The synthetic radius distribution is characterized by a strong increase towards small R, and a second, lower local maximum at ~1 Jovian radius. The increase towards small radii reflects the increase of the mass function towards low M. The second local maximum is due to the fact that radii are nearly independent of mass for giant planets. A comparison of the synthetic radius distribution with Kepler data shows agreement for R>2 Earth radii, but divergence for smaller radii. We predict that in the next few years, Kepler should find the second, local maximum at ~1 Jovian radius.},

abstract = {Aims: We extend the models presented by Mordasini and collaborators to the formation of planets orbiting stars of different masses. We discuss the properties of the resulting synthetic planet population in terms of mass, orbit, and metallicity distributions. Methods: The population synthesis calculations that we use are based on the Bernese planet formation model developed by Alibert and collaborators, which self-consistently takes into account planetary growth and migration in an evolving proto-planetary disk. Using this model, we generate synthetic populations of planets by following their growth in a large number of proto-planetary disks, whose properties (mass and lifetime) are selected in a Monte Carlo fashion using probability distributions derived from observations. Results: We show that the scaling of the proto-planetary disk mass with the mass of the central star has a direct and large influence on the properties of the resulting planet population. In particular, the observed paucity of high mass planets orbiting 0.5 M_{\&}sun; stars can be directly explained as resulting from a only slightly steeper than linear scaling. The observed lack of short period planets orbiting 2.0 M_{\&}sun; stars can also be attributed to this scaling but only if associated with a decrease in the mean disk lifetime for stars more massive than 1.5 M_{\&}sun;. Finally, we show that the distribution of minimum mass and semi-major axis of our synthetic planets are statistically comparable with observations.},

abstract = {A first characterization of many exoplanets has recently been achieved by the observational determination of their radius. For some planets, a measurement of the luminosity has also been possible, with many more directly imaged planets expected in the future. The statistical characterization of exoplanets through their mass-radius and mass-luminosity diagram is thus becoming possible. This is for planet formation and evolution theory of similar importance as the mass-distance diagram. Our aim in this and a companion paper is to extend our formation model into a coupled formation and evolution model. We want to calculate in a self-consistent way all basic characteristics (M,a,R,L) of a planet and use the model for population synthesis calculations. Here we show how we solve the structure equations describing the gaseous envelope not only during the early formation phase, but also during gas runaway accretion, and during the evolutionary phase at constant mass on Gyr timescales. We then study the in situ formation and evolution of Jupiter, the mass-radius relationship of giants, the influence of the core mass on the radius and the luminosity both in the "hot start" and the "cold start" scenario. We put special emphasis on the comparison with other models. We find that our results agree very well with those of more complex models, despite a number of simplifications. The upgraded model yields the most important characteristics of a planet from its beginning as a seed embryo to a Gyr old planet. This is the case for all planets in a synthetic planetary population. Therefore, we can now use self-consistently the statistical constraints coming from all major observational techniques. This is important in a time where different techniques yield constraints on very diverse sub-populations of planets, and where its is challenging to put all these constraints together in one coherent picture.},

abstract = {The compact multi-transiting planet systems discovered by Kepler challenge planet formation theories. Formation in situ from disks with radial mass surface density, $\Sigma$, profiles similar to the minimum mass solar nebula but boosted in normalization by factors >~ 10 has been suggested. We propose that a more natural way to create these planets in the inner disk is formation sequentially from the inside-out via creation of successive gravitationally unstable rings fed from a continuous stream of small (~cm-m size) "pebbles," drifting inward via gas drag. Pebbles collect at the pressure maximum associated with the transition from a magnetorotational instability (MRI)-inactive ("dead zone") region to an inner MRI-active zone. A pebble ring builds up until it either becomes gravitationally unstable to form an ~1 M ⊕ planet directly or induces gradual planet formation via core accretion. The planet may undergo Type I migration into the active region, allowing a new pebble ring and planet to form behind it. Alternatively, if migration is inefficient, the planet may continue to accrete from the disk until it becomes massive enough to isolate itself from the accretion flow. A variety of densities may result depending on the relative importance of residual gas accretion as the planet approaches its isolation mass. The process can repeat with a new pebble ring gathering at the new pressure maximum associated with the retreating dead-zone boundary. Our simple analytical model for this scenario of inside-out planet formation yields planetary masses, relative mass scalings with orbital radius, and minimum orbital separations consistent with those seen by Kepler. It provides an explanation of how massive planets can form with tightly packed and well-aligned system architectures, starting from typical protoplanetary disk properties.},

abstract = {The existence of extrasolar planets with short orbital periods suggests that planetary migration induced by tidal interaction with the protoplanetary disk is important. Cores and terrestrial planets may undergo migration as they form. In this paper we investigate the evolution of a population of cores with initial masses in the range 0.1-1 M⊕ embedded in a disk. Mutual interactions lead to orbit crossing and mergers, so that the cores grow during their evolution. Interaction with the disk leads to orbital migration, which results in the cores capturing each other in mean motion resonances. As the cores migrate inside the disk inner edge, scatterings and mergers of planets on unstable orbits, together with orbital circularization, causes strict commensurability to be lost. Near commensurability however is usually maintained. All the simulations end with a population typically between two and five planets, with masses depending on the initial mass. These results indicate that if hot super-Earths or Neptunes form by mergers of inwardly migrating cores, then such planets are most likely not isolated. We would expect to always find at least one, more likely a few, companions on close and often near-commensurable orbits. To test this hypothesis, it would be of interest to look for planets of a few to about 10 M⊕ in systems where hot super-Earths or Neptunes have already been found.},

abstract = {Context: This is the second paper in a series of papers showing the results of extrasolar planet population synthesis calculations using our extended core accretion model. In the companion paper (Paper I), we presented in detail the methods we use. In subsequent papers, we shall discuss the effect of the host star's mass on the planetary population and the influence of various properties of protoplanetary disks. Aims: In this second paper, we focus on planets orbiting solar-like stars. The goal is to use the main characteristics of the actually observed extrasolar planet population to derive in a statistical manner constraints on the planet formation models. Methods: Drawing initial conditions for our models at random from probability distributions derived as closely as possible from observations, we synthesize a number of planetary populations. By applying an observational detection bias appropriate for radial velocity surveys, we identify the potentially detectable synthetic planets. The properties of these planets are compared in quantitative statistical tests with the properties of a carefully selected sub-population of actually observed extrasolar planets. Results: We use a two dimensional Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to compare the mass-distance distributions of synthetic and observed planets, as well as the one dimensional version of the test to compare the M sin i, the semimajor axis and the [Fe/H] distribution. We find that while many combinations of parameters lead to unacceptable distributions, a number of models can account to a reasonable degree of statistical significance for most of the properties of the observed sample. We concurrently account for many other observed features, e.g. the ``metallicity effect''. This gives us confidence that our model captures several essential features of giant planet formation. In addition, the fact that many parameter combinations could be rejected indicates that planet population synthesis is indeed a promising approach to constrain formation models. Our simulations allow us also to extract a number of properties of the underlying exoplanet population that are not yet directly detectable. For example, we have derived the planetary initial mass function (PIMF) and have been led to conclude that the planets detected so far represent only the tip of the iceberg (9%) of all the existing planets. The PIMF can also be used to predict how the detectable extrasolar planet population will change as the instrumental precision of radial velocity surveys improves from ~10 m/s to ~1 m/s, or even to an extreme precision of 0.1 m/s.},

abstract = {Context. This is the fourth paper in a series showing the results of planet population synthesis calculations. In Paper I, we presented our methods. In Paper II, we compared the synthetic and the observed planetary population statistically. Paper III addressed the influences of the stellar mass on the population. Aims: Our goal in this fourth paper is to systematically study the effects of important disk properties, namely disk metallicity, mass, and lifetime on fundamental properties of planets like mass and semimajor axis. Methods: For a large number of protoplanetary disks that have properties following distributions derived from observations, we calculated a population of planets with our formation model. The model is based on the classical core accretion paradigm but self-consistently includes planet migration and disk evolution. Results: We find a very large number of correlations. Regarding the planetary initial mass function, metallicity, Mdisk, and $\tau$disk play different roles. For high metallicities, giant planets are more frequent. For high Mdisk, giant planets are more massive. For long $\tau$disk, giant planets are both more frequent and massive. At low metallicities, very massive giant planets cannot form, but otherwise giant planet mass and metallicity are nearly uncorrelated. In contrast, (maximum) planet masses and disk gas masses are correlated. The formation of giant planets is possible for initial planetesimal surface densities $\Sigma$S of at least 6 g/cm2 at 5.2 AU. The best spot for giant planet formation is at ~5 AU. In- and outside this distance, higher $\Sigma$S are necessary. Low metallicities can be compensated for by high Mdisk, and vice versa, but not ad infinitum. At low metallicities, giant planets only form outside the ice line, while giant planet formation occurs throughout the disk at high metallicities. The extent of migration increases with Mdisk and $\tau$disk and usually decreases with metallicity. No clear correlation of metallicity and the semimajor axis distribution of giant planets exists because in low-metallicity disks, planets start farther out, but migrate more, while the contrary applies to high metallicities. The final semimajor axis distribution contains an imprint of the ice line. Close-in low mass planets have a lower mean metallicity than hot Jupiters. The frequency of giant planets varies approximately as Mdisk1.2 and $\tau$disk2. Conclusions: The properties of protoplanetary disks - the initial and boundary conditions for planet formation - are decisive for the properties of planets, and leave many imprints on the population.},

abstract = {The formation of planetary cores must proceed rapidly in order for the giant planets to accrete their gaseous envelopes before the dissipation of the protoplanetary gas disc (≲3 Myr). In orbits beyond 10 AU, direct accumulation of planetesimals by the cores is too slow. Fragments of planetesimals could be accreted faster, but planetesimals are likely too large for fragmentation to be efficient, and resonant trapping poses an additional hurdle. Here we instead investigate the accretion of small pebbles (mm-cm sizes) that are the natural outcome of an equilibrium between the growth and radial drift of particles. We construct a simplified analytical model of dust coagulation and pebble drift in the outer disc, between 5 AU and 100 AU, which gives the temporal evolution of the solid surface density and the dominant particle size. These two key quantities determine how core growth proceeds at various orbital distances. We find that pebble surface densities are sufficiently high to achieve the inside-out formation of planetary cores within the disc lifetime. The overall efficiency by which dust gets converted to planets can be high, close to 50% for planetary architectures similar to the solar system. Growth by pebble accretion in the outer disc is sufficiently fast to overcome catastrophic type I migration of the cores. These results require protoplanetary discs with large radial extent (≳100 AU) and assume a low number of initial seed embryos. Our findings imply that protoplanetary discs with low disc masses, as expected around low-mass stars (<1 M⊙), or with sub-solar dust-to-gas ratios, do not easily form gas-giant planets (M ≳ 100 ME), but preferentially form Neptune-mass planets or smaller (M ≲ 10 ME). This is consistent with exoplanet surveys which show that gas giants are relatively uncommon around stars of low mass or low metallicity.},

abstract = {Planetary bodies form by accretion of smaller bodies. It has been suggested that a very efficient way to grow protoplanets is by accreting particles of size ≪km (e.g., chondrules, boulders, or fragments of larger bodies) as they can be kept dynamically cold. We investigate the effects of gas drag on the impact radii and the accretion rates of these particles. As simplifying assumptions we restrict our analysis to 2D settings, a gas drag law linear in velocity, and a laminar disk characterized by a smooth (global) pressure gradient that causes particles to drift in radially. These approximations, however, enable us to cover an arbitrary large parameter space. The framework of the circularly restricted three body problem is used to numerically integrate particle trajectories and to derive their impact parameters. Three accretion modes can be distinguished: hyperbolic encounters, where the 2-body gravitational focusing enhances the impact parameter; three-body encounters, where gas drag enhances the capture probability; and settling encounters, where particles settle towards the protoplanet. An analysis of the observed behavior is presented; and we provide a recipe to analytically calculate the impact radius, which confirms the numerical findings. We apply our results to the sweepup of fragments by a protoplanet at a distance of 5 AU. Accretion of debris on small protoplanets (⪉50 km) is found to be slow, because the fragments are distributed over a rather thick layer. However, the newly found settling mechanism, which is characterized by much larger impact radii, becomes relevant for protoplanets of ~103 km in size and provides a much faster channel for growth.},

abstract = {We performed 3D MHD simulations of planet migration in stratified disks using the Godunov code PLUTO, where the disk is turbulent due to the magnetorotational instability. We study the migration for planets with different planet-star mass ratios $q=M_{p}/M_{s}$. In agreement with previous studies, for the low-mass planet cases ($q=5\times10^{-6}$ and $10^{-5}$), migration is dominated by random fluctuations in the torque. For a Jupiter-mass planet $(q=M_{p}/M_{s}=10^{-3}$ for $M_{s}=1M_{\odot})$, we find a reduction of the magnetic stress inside the orbit of the planet and around the gap region. After an initial stage where the torque on the planet is positive, it reverses and we recover migration rates similar to those found in disks where the turbulent viscosity is modelled by an $\alpha$ viscosity. For the intermediate-mass planets ($q=5\times10^{-5}, 10^{-4}$ and $2\times10^{-4}$) we find a new and so far unexpected behavior. In some cases they experience sustained and systematic outwards migration for the entire duration of the simulation. For this case, the horseshoe region is resolved and torques coming from the corotation region can remain unsaturated due to the stresses in the disk. These stresses are generated directly by the magnetic field. The magnitude of the horseshoe drag can overcome the negative Lindblad contribution when the local surface density profile is flat or increasing outwards, which we see in certain locations in our simulations due to the presence of a zonal flow. The intermediate-mass planet is migrating radially outwards in locations where there is a positive gradient of a pressure bump (zonal flow).

abstract = {The observed lifetimes of gaseous protoplanetary discs place strong constraints on gas and ice giant formation in the core accretion scenario. The approximately 10-Earth-mass solid core responsible for the attraction of the gaseous envelope has to form before gas dissipation in the protoplanetary disc is completed within 1-10 million years. Building up the core by collisions between km-sized planetesimals fails to meet this timescale constraint, especially at wide stellar separations. Nonetheless, gas-giant planets are detected by direct imaging at wide orbital distances. In this paper, we numerically study the growth of cores by the accretion of cm-sized pebbles loosely coupled to the gas. We measure the accretion rate onto seed masses ranging from a large planetesimal to a fully grown 10-Earth-mass core and test different particle sizes. The numerical results are in good agreement with our analytic expressions, indicating the existence of two accretion regimes, one set by the azimuthal and radial particle drift for the lower seed masses and the other, for higher masses, by the velocity at the edge of the Hill sphere. In the former, the optimally accreted particle size increases with core mass, while in the latter the optimal size is centimeters, independent of core mass. We discuss the implications for rapid core growth of gas-giant and ice-giant cores. We conclude that pebble accretion can resolve the long-standing core accretion timescale conflict. This requires a near-unity dust-to-gas ratio in the midplane, particle growth to mm and cm and the formation of massive planetesimals or low radial pressure support. The core growth timescale is shortened by a factor 30-1000 at 5 AU and by a factor 100-10 000 at 50 AU, compared to the gravitationally focused accretion of, respectively, low-scale-height planetesimal fragments or standard km-sized planetesimals.},

It is found that various mixtures consisting of graphite, silicon carbide, enstatite, olivine, iron, and magnetite are acceptable, that all the acceptable mixtures contain spherical uncoated graphite particles, and that graphite is the main contributor to the 2160-A feature. The required particle-size distribution is shown to be quite broad, with approximately a power-law distribution, for all substances considered. The sizes for graphite are estimated to vary from about 0.005 to about 1 micron, and the observed uniformity of extinction over the sky is explained in terms of a rather uniform power-law exponent, which could have resulted from a stochastic process in grain formation},
